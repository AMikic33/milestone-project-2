                        In a world where indulging our passions has become second nature, travel has become 
                        more than just an enjoyable getaway, but a means by which to explore interests old 
                        and new. Why and where we choose to travel is a choice motivated by a number of factors, 
                        each of which varies from person to person. From history and cuisine to discovering the 
                        world's best beaches, these are motivators that come up time and again. But recently, 
                        there has been a long overdue shift to traveling for the arts.

                    <p>
                        The arts have always held a mesmeric power in their ability to shine a spotlight onto 
                        destinations and neighborhoods that, perhaps, we would not have considered otherwise. 
                        Traveling through the lens of galleries, museums, architecture, theatre and more shows 
                        another side to these destinations, as you step away from the crowds to discover a world 
                        which gives you a true flavor for a destination, its culture and its people.
