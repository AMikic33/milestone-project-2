# Art finder Website

This project is to create a website that finds art around us no matter where we are. The user can select any city on earth and choose his or hers interests, such as librares, museums, book store and more. 

Once the city and the option of interest has been selected, the user can see all results on the map. 
Essetially, the website can be used when a user is planning a trip or on the go. 

## UX

This project was designed for all art lovers who want to discover and/or visit art places whereever they go. 

The website contains scrollspy which makes it very easy to use. To find the needed info, all the user has to do is insert the city they'll visit, and choose one of the interests. 

The interests are being displayed in buttons, which increase in size when hovered over and the text changes colour, to make it even easier for the user to choose the correct interest. This is especially handy on mobile version.
