# Art finder Website

This project is to create a website that finds art around us no matter where we are. The user can select any city on Earth and choose their interests, such as librares, museums, book stores and more. 

Once the city and the option of interest have been selected, the user can see the results on the map. 
Essentially, the website can be used when a user is planning a trip or on the go. 

## UX

This project was designed for all art lovers who want to discover and/or visit art places where ever they go. 

The interests are being displayed in buttons, which increase in size when hovered over and the text changes colour, to make it even easier for the user to choose the correct interest. This is especially handy on the mobile version.

The buttons also change the color when clicked, making the choice of the interest even more obvious. 

Furthermore, there is a "current selection" part, to show to the user their current selection. This is resetted with every new search.


### User Stories

- as a new customer, I would like to search for museums and art galleries when in a foreign city, so that I can have a better perception of the local culture.
- as a new customer, I would like to search for book stores, especially the small, localy owned stores, because there are always interesting books to find. 
- as a new customer, I would like to explore the architecture when in a foreign city, such as city halls, museums and stadiums.
- as a new customer, I would like to search for all tourist attractions, so that I am able to make a plan for my trip.


##### Returning customers

- as a returning customer, I would like to check on the map which places of interest will be in the vicinity of my hotel. 
- as a returning customer, I would like to double check the addresses of the places I'm planning to visit, so I can make my trip schedule. 
- as a returning customer, I would like to find the addresses of the places I have visited few years ago.
